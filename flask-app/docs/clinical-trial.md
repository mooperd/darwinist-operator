# Key Questions for Trialling a Clinical AI

## 1. Clinical Relevance and Utility
- **What clinical problem is the AI solving?**
  - Is it addressing a genuine clinical need or gap in practice?
  - How does it improve patient outcomes, workflow, or decision-making?
  
- **Is the AI better than existing methods?**
  - Does it offer superior accuracy, speed, or efficiency?
  - How well does it integrate into current clinical workflows (e.g., EHRs)?

## 2. Data Quality and Validity
- **What type of data is used to train the AI?**
  - Is the data representative of the target population in terms of demographics and clinical setting?
  - Does the data meet quality, completeness, and relevance standards?

- **How large and diverse is the training dataset?**
  - Does it cover variability in patient populations (age, ethnicity, co-morbidities)?

- **Has the AI been validated externally?**
  - Has the AI been tested across different settings and populations to ensure generalizability?

## 3. Performance and Accuracy
- **How accurate is the AI?**
  - What are the sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy metrics?
  
- **How does the AI handle edge cases or rare conditions?**
  - Does it perform well in rare or less-represented cases?

- **How is performance monitored over time?**
  - Is there a mechanism to monitor and maintain accuracy as clinical practices evolve?

## 4. Safety and Risk
- **What are the potential risks or harms to patients?**
  - Could the AI lead to incorrect diagnoses, treatment delays, or other adverse outcomes?
  - What safeguards are in place to mitigate these risks?

- **How are safety concerns handled?**
  - How does the AI respond to uncertainty or failure scenarios?

- **What is the role of human oversight?**
  - Will clinicians review or override the AI’s recommendations?

## 5. Ethics and Bias
- **Is the AI system fair and unbiased?**
  - Has the AI been tested for bias against minority or vulnerable populations?
  - Are there disparities in care delivery due to AI outputs?

- **How does the AI respect patient autonomy?**
  - Does it promote patient-centered care, and are patients informed about its use?

- **How is data privacy maintained?**
  - What measures are in place to protect patient data (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR compliance)?

## 6. User Experience and Usability
- **How do clinicians interact with the AI?**
  - Is it intuitive and seamlessly integrated into clinical workflows?
  - How does it impact clinicians’ cognitive load or workload?

- **What training is required to use the AI?**
  - Is special training needed to use the AI effectively?

- **Is there transparency in AI decision-making?**
  - Does the AI provide understandable explanations for its decisions?

## 7. Regulatory and Legal Compliance
- **Is the AI compliant with regulatory standards?**
  - Has it received approval from regulatory bodies (e.g., FDA, CE, MHRA)?

- **Who is liable for errors?**
  - How is liability determined in case of adverse events or errors due to AI?

## 8. Cost-effectiveness and Sustainability
- **Is the AI cost-effective?**
  - Does it reduce healthcare costs (e.g., fewer misdiagnoses, shorter hospital stays)?
  
- **How is the AI system funded?**
  - What are the costs of acquisition, implementation, and maintenance?

- **Is the AI scalable?**
  - Can it be implemented across various healthcare settings (e.g., rural vs urban)?

## 9. Patient and Stakeholder Acceptance
- **Do patients trust the AI?**
  - How do patients perceive AI-driven care, and are they comfortable with its use?

- **Are clinicians and staff accepting of the AI?**
  - Are healthcare providers confident in the AI's recommendations?

- **How is feedback incorporated?**
  - Is there a mechanism for feedback from clinicians and patients on AI performance?

## 10. Long-term Impact and Monitoring
- **How will the AI be monitored post-deployment?**
  - What are the plans for long-term monitoring of outcomes, unintended consequences, or system improvements?

- **How will the AI adapt to new medical knowledge?**
  - Does it have a mechanism to update itself based on new guidelines or research?
